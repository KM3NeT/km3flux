# Honda 2015 

## About

Parse [tables](http://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mhonda/) from [Honda 2015](http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.023004) paper.

Currently only Azimmuth-averaged. 

Frejus-Solarminimum is my personal favorite (close to ORCA).

Unfortunately, if you want a different earthlocation/non-azimuth-averaged tables, the per-zenith-split tables
have to be generated manually at the moment.

## Units

all energy GeV
Flux (m^2 sec sr GeV)

cosine column is bincenter: 
    [0.8 -- 0.9] => 0.85
